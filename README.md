# Datarouter

## Overview

Datarouter is a Java database abstraction layer 
  that gives developers a simple interface to a variety of databases. 
It sits on top of other database client libraries and encourages access through a standard set of methods 
  allowing an application to mix and match databases 
  while staying independent of any particular database product. 
The application is programmed against Datarouterâ€™s interfaces 
  while JDBC, Memcached, HBase, etc are left as swappable dependencies.
Developers can also choose to code directly against a specific database in performance critical situations 
  or when using unique features of a particular product, 
  still leaving the vast majority of the code in a portable state.

The first goal of Datarouter is to encourage type-safety and early error detection in all layers of your application
  so that it remains easy to refactor as it grows. 
Waiting for the results of an integration or even unit test suite is too slow 
  for the frequent refactoring that's needed to quickly evolve an application beyond the original design goals. 
We want to catch errors at compile time, 
  particularly when the Eclipse incremental compiler runs, 
  and give your IDE the ability to automatically change large amounts of code.

The second goal is to encourage safe interactions with your database, 
  making it easy to fetch data in a way that won't trigger expensive queries 
  and making it harder to accidentally cause large tablescans or joins that can affect the overall application health.

The third goal is the portability mentioned above. 
Knowing your application is portable from the get-go means you can jump in and start writing code 
  without spending a lot of time debating which database you'll use 
  or which cloud provider you'll be tied to. 
A program can start out with a traditional relational database like MySQL, 
  and as certain tables grow they can be offloaded to more scalable systems 
  after trivial code changes. 
Or you might run on multiple systems at the same time, 
  such as a multi-cloud application that uses Aurora, SQS, and Elasticache Memcached in Amazon's cloud 
  while also using Cloud SQL, Cloud Pub/Sub and Memcached in Google's cloud.

For more information about the storage design, see the [datarouter-storage README](datarouter-storage/README.md).

Datarouter includes a web framework (datarouter-web) that aims to be lightweight
  and to rely on Java (not XML, JSON, or plain text) 
  for configuring things like web request handler mappings. 
Additional modules like datarouter-exception, datarouter-job, datarouter-trace, etc 
  include many building blocks of a web app 
  like log management, authentication, cron triggering, exception recording, counters, etc. 
Combining the storage and web frameworks and the added utils allows for building portable web apps 
  that are easy to move between different database engines. 
For example, you could record exception stack traces to MySQL on your laptop, 
  to HBase in your datacenter, 
  DynamoDB when running on AWS, 
  or Bigtable when running on Google Cloud.
