		<h1>Memcached client and transformation utils</h1>

		<p>
			Usage should be pretty straightforward.  Get a MemcachedClient object and
			start setting and getting stuff in memcached.
		</p>
		<p>
			All operations are asynchronous internally, but most at least provide
			synchronous convenience interfaces.  Some only provide synchronous
			interfaces (getVersion, getStats) and some only provide asynchronous
			interfaces (delete, flush).  That'll probably all get cleared up if it
			bothers anyone.
