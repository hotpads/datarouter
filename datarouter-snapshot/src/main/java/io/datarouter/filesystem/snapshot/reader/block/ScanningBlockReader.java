 * Thread-safe
 *
 * The parallel operations perform the potentially high-latency block fetches
 *
 * The blocks are passed to the parent scanner which parses them.  The parsing could potentially be done in the parallel
 * section, but it would result in more objects being allocated at the same time.  The parsing of the blocks is pretty
 * inexpensive, so this version leaves that for the parent reader thread.
