## About

This module adds features and implementations to datarouter-secret, using datarouter-storage and datarouter-web. Many
of these are defaulted in `DatarouterSecretWebPluginBuilder`

`DatarouterSecretOpRecordDao` simply records `SecretOp`s into a storage node.

`SecretHandler` is the recommended way to manually access `Secret`s. It is a simple CRUD UI that takes advantage of all
the built-in features of `SecretService`.

`DatarouterPropertiesAndServiceSecretNamespacer` is a useful implementation of `SecretNamespacer` with the following
behavior: for "app-specific" `Secret`s, the namespace is "\<environment type\>/\<service name\>/", and for "shared"
`Secret`s, the namespace is "\<environment type\>/shared/". Environment type is determined by
`DatarouterProperties#getEnvironmentType`, and service name is determined by `DatarouterService#getName`.
