 * For counting the cost of cloud services.
 * "Nanos" are billionths of dollars.
 * Should be viewed as estimates.
 * Factors that affect costs:
 *   - Time: they tend to drop over time
 *   - Location: they differ by cloud region
 *   - Usage: price can reduce for higher usage
 *   - Reservations: price can be lower if you pre-pay for an amount
 *   - Taxes: these estimates don't include taxes
 *   - Discounts: large customers might negotiate discounts
