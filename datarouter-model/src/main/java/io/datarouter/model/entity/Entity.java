/**
 * An Entity is a grouping of related databeans that are stored within the same transaction scope.
 *
 * For example, a User Entity may be comprised of several databean types: a single UserInfo Databean and a collection of
 * UserRole databeans. In a partitioned RDBMS, the Entity will span two tables per partition, but data for a single User
 * will reside in the same partition. In schema-less datastores, all databeans for the Entity can be serialized into an
 * atomic unit like a single Memcached object or a single HBase row. All databeans in the Entity can be fetched together
 * with a single call to entityNode.get(entityKey). For the RDBMS, this will execute a single txn with two select
 * operations. For Memcached or HBase the get() will execute in a single operation.
 *
 * The Entity facilitates passing around a group of related Databeans as a single java object.
