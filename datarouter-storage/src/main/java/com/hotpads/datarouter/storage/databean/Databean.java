/**
 * A Databean is an atomic unit of serialization corresponding to a MySQL row or a Memcached item. Generally, all fields
 * of the databean are read from the datastore together even if some are not wanted, and they are written to the
 * datastore together even if some are not updated.
 *
 * Every Databean has a single PrimaryKey which determines its uniqueness and ordering among other databeans of the same
 * type. This is determined by the hashCode(), equals(), and compareTo() methods in the PrimaryKey and should generally
 * not be modified.
 *
 * While Databeans consist of more code than JDO or JPA style databeans, they add many rich features such as: a strongly
 * typed PrimaryKey, equality, ordering, automatic schema updating, the ability to define multiple Fielders for
 * different storage formats, and the ability to serialize to arbitrary formats like JSON, Memcached, a file, or
 * HBase. Databeans are often the foundation of a project, and comprise a minority of the code so the trade-off is
 * usually worthwhile.
 *
 * To create a databean you can copy/paste/modify a similar existing databean or use the web tool. If you prefer a
 * lighter-weight format, you can omit the Fielder definition and add Hibernate annotations, but this isn't recommended
 * as it's comparable work to define a Fielder.
