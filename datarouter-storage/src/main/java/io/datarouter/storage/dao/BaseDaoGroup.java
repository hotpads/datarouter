/**
 * A DaoGroup is a collection of related DAOs. It is easy to trace all uses of each DAO through your code using tools
 * like Eclipse's ctrl-shift-G shortcut.
 *
 * While a small application could have only one DaoGroup, a large application could group related DAOs into separate
 * DaoGroups. A good rule of thumb is to have one DaoGroup per database or per each major function of the application.
 *
 * A DAO can easily be moved between different DaoGroups. DaoGroups ensure that DAOs are only registered once. They also
 * ensure that all DAOs can be eagerly found so that schema updates can be performed before the application starts.
